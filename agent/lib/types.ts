   * class, it is the fail-closed guardrail branch plus `inbox.orderAuto`, which
   * ships FALSE and stays false until module 11 (FD-3).
   *
   * `offer_chat_discount` is the ONLY way Nova may sell below list. It mints a
   * Coupon row; it never touches a price. `update_price` exists and is a
   * store-wide act with its own margin guardrail — answering one customer's
   * haggle by repricing the product discounts every other customer that day.
   *
   * `verify_payment_slip` VERIFIES NOTHING, and the name is the one place that
   * could mislead. Dakio has no payment-gateway API, so it files the customer's
   * CLAIM for the owner to judge and never writes `Order.paid`. It is `high`
   * risk AND in `ALWAYS_DRAFT` (`authority.ts`), because risk alone does not
   * mean "always ask": `verdictForLevel` executes every risk class at level 4,
   * and a trusted store would otherwise auto-"verify" money nobody read.
   *
   * THE INVERSES ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THIS UNION, and that is deliberate — same
   * as `cancel_followup` (module 04) and `unlink_customer` (module 03). An undo
   * is dispatched by dakio-api's `UNDO[undoData.kind]`, keyed by the STRING the
   * executor returns in `undoData.kind`, while nova-ai's `undoers` map is keyed
   * by the VERB name. Two maps, two keying schemes, both correct; the `kind`
   * string is the only bridge, and omitting it is what made a founder tapping
   * Undo see "No inverse is defined for undefined" twice already. The slugs
   * module 05 owns, fixed here so the two repos cannot each invent one:
   *
   *   create_order_from_chat → undoData.kind `cancel_chat_order`
   *                            (cancels a PENDING order only — a parcel already
   *                            with the courier is not undoable by software)
   *   offer_chat_discount    → undoData.kind `deactivate_chat_discount`

 *    on a wire that carries taka, and the first reader to trust it ships a 100×
 *    error at a real customer's door.
 * 2. **NO PRICE LEVER.** {@link ChatOrderRequest} carries no `discount`, no
 *    `paid`, no `unitPrice` and no `total`. The server prices the order from
 *    the catalogue; the only honest way to sell below list is a Coupon row.
 *    The merchant order route accepts a raw client `discount` that flows
