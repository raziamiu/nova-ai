/**
 * What a chat order will cost, in WHOLE TAKA, for the auto-order cap only.
 *
 * The payload carries NO money — no `unitPrice`, no `total`, deliberately (see
 * module 05's payload header in `nova/schemas.ts`) — so the cap has to price the
 * order itself. It prices from the CATALOGUE, never from anything the model
 * wrote, which is the whole reason the payload is shaped that way.
 *
 * `null` means UNPRICEABLE and the caller must draft. Returning 0 for a product
 * that would not read would be a total under every cap.
 *
 * TWO DELIBERATE OVER-ESTIMATES, both in the fail-closed direction:
 *
 *  - delivery is charged at the OUTSIDE-Dhaka rate, always. The real charge
 *    depends on an inside/outside-Dhaka test that lives in dakio-api, and
 *    restating that predicate here would be a second copy of a rule that
 *    decides money — the failure this repo has already had to fix twice.
 *    Taking the larger of the two can only push an order OVER the cap, which
 *    drafts; guessing the smaller could let one under it.
 *  - a coupon is ignored. It lowers the real total, so ignoring it can only
 *    over-state — and the coupon is re-validated server-side and may not hold
 *    at all, so subtracting a discount the order might not get would be sizing
 *    against a price nobody was charged.
 *
 * So this is an upper bound on what the customer will be asked to pay, and the
 * cap is a bound on what Nova may commit alone. Comparing the two is the
 * conservative pairing.
