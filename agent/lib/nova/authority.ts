/**

 *
 * Every action Nova attempts is judged here: founder-only verb → no-touch lock
 * → duty → mode → level → guardrails. **First refusal wins**, and every verdict
 * names the exact rule that produced it, because "Nova refused" is useless to a
 * founder and "Nova refused: no_touch:saree pricing" is actionable.
 *
 * Three rules this module exists to make unbreakable:
 *
 *  1. **Model output can propose, never authorize.** Nothing here reads model
 *     text as permission. Locks and duty names are DATA — they are matched
 *     against, never interpreted as instructions.
 *  2. **Fail closed.** Any lookup that errors or returns something unexpected
 *     refuses. A gate that fails open is not a gate.
 *  3. **Ambiguity resolves toward refusal.** A false freeze costs the founder a
 *     tap; a false pass breaks a promise they made to themselves.
 *
 * There is deliberately no second gate: `checkGuardrails` from `autonomy.ts` is
 * called from inside this seam as the platform superset, not alongside it.

/**
 * The inverse of FOUNDER_ONLY: verbs the tier dial may never hold back.
 *
 * `escalate_conversation` is the one that matters today — asking for a human
 * must work at every tier, including Shadow, or the safest thing Nova can do
 * becomes the slowest. Escalation sends nothing the model authored (the
 * holding line is a deterministic server template) and it hands authority
 * AWAY, so there is nothing for a level ceiling to protect against.
 *
 * Everything before this check still applies: a founder-only verb, a no-touch
 * lock, an unknown duty, and a duty the founder explicitly paused all win.
 *
 * Module 03 added `link_customer_identity` — bookkeeping in the same sense:
 * it writes a JOIN, sends the customer nothing, exposes nothing (the 360 is a
 * separate server-side read), and its undo removes the join cleanly. It must
 * work at T0 Shadow because a thread Nova cannot identify is a thread Nova
 * answers blind.
 *
 * **Module 08 examined this set and added NOTHING — do not re-litigate it from
 * the doc.** The sentence above used to promise that module 08 would "extend
 * this set with the rest of its bookkeeping verbs"; it shipped and it did not,
 * for four separate reasons, all verified against the code:
 *
 *  - The mechanism the doc names, `BOOKKEEPING_VERBS` — "a set consulted before
 *    the ceiling check" — exists in no repo. This set is that mechanism, and it
 *    is consulted at "3b" below, before the ceiling, exactly as described. There
 *    is nothing to build; there was only something to find.
 *  - `open_case` and `flag_courier_issue` are module 06's and module 06 has not
 *    shipped, so neither string exists to add. Worse for the doc's own case,
 *    module 06 specifies `flag_courier_issue` as forced `needs_approval` ALWAYS
 *    — the exact opposite of never-gated. Two docs, one verb, contradictory
 *    rulings: 06 owns it, and the ruling is 06's to make when it lands.
 *  - `schedule_follow_up` stays out for the reasons written below, and a
 *    CI check pins its absence.
 *  - `refund_promise` does not exist at all (see `FOUNDER_ONLY` above).
 *
 * So the honest statement of module 08's tier carve-out is: it is this set, it
 * has two members, and module 08 added none of them. A future module extends it
 * by naming a verb that EXISTS and arguing membership on the terms below — never
 * by pre-registering a name from a doc.
 *
 * **Know what membership costs.** The check at "3b" below returns BEFORE
 * `effectiveLevel`/`verdictForLevel` and BEFORE `checkGuardrailsForAuthority`,
 * so a never-gated verb bypasses the tier dial and every numeric guardrail. It
 * is safe for these two only because neither can spend, send, or choose: the
 * SERVER decides the link (exact single match, or a server-side digit compare)
 * and the model supplies a phone, never a customerId to link to. What it does
 * NOT bypass is the duty ladder above — a founder who pauses
 * `support.inbox_replies` still stops the link, and an off-roster `dutyRef`
 * still fails closed.
 *
 * **`schedule_follow_up` is deliberately NOT here (module 04, OD-6), and this
 * DIVERGES from the module-04 doc**, which classes it a bookkeeping verb that
 * executes at every tier including T0 Shadow on the grounds that it "sends
 * nothing customer-visible". That is true of the scheduling and false of its
 * consequence. `link_customer_identity` above ends where it starts — a join
 * written, nothing owed, nobody contacted. Scheduling a follow-up ends with
 * Nova speaking to a customer at a time it picked; the send is gated on its
 * own, but membership here would let a T0 Shadow store, whose whole promise is
 * that Nova only watches, accumulate real commitments the founder never
 * approved. The cost of leaving it out is named honestly: it does not execute
 * at T0, and `support.inbox_replies`' minLevel 2 plus any future `inbox.*` cap
 * apply to it — which is the point.
