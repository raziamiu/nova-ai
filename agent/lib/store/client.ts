/**
 * The boundary between Nova and the Dakio store.
 *
 * Nova only ever talks to a `StoreClient`. Today that resolves to a
 * per-tenant in-memory demo backend (`backend.ts`), one seeded dataset per
 * store. When the real Express store API is ready, implement this same
 * interface with `fetch()` calls and swap the constructor in
 * `storeFor` (`resolve.ts`) — no tool, subagent, or schedule changes required.
 *
 * The store persists Nova's own data too (memory, activity, prepared
 * actions, reports), matching the Dakio design where the store server saves
 * all agent data.
 *
 * Every data-access method is async (a real implementation is a network
 * call). `now()` is the one exception — it is a local clock read, not a
 * request, so callers can build timestamps without awaiting a round trip.
 *
 * There is no process-wide client. A `StoreClient` is always tenant-bound and
 * resolved per call via `storeFor(ctx)` in `resolve.ts` — see `requireStore`
 * in `lib/tenant.ts` for how the tenant is derived from verified auth.
